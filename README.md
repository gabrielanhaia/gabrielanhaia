## Hey, I'm Gabriel Anhaia

Software engineer, author, and open-source enthusiast based in Germany (originally from Brazil). I work across backend systems, distributed architectures, and increasingly with AI. Currently building things at **Monta GmbH** and writing at **Dev Warlocks**.

I care about clean architecture, design patterns, developer education, and shipping things that matter.
